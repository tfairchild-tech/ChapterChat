                        <h2>What is Chapter Chat?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Chapter Chat is a tool used by students, parents and teachers to measure students reading comprehension,
                        reading levels and learning styles.  It is designed to increase a student’s intrinsic motivation for reading by
                        giving the student solid insight into their reading abilities and styles.

                        <p>
                            Chapter Chat uses two types of quizzes.  The first type is the primary quiz.  These are used to measure the
                            student’s progress, reading level and reading comprehension. The second is the practice quiz.  Practice quizzes
                            are for the student’s benefit only.  The purpose of practice quizzes is to challenge and motivate the student to
                            read at higher levels without impacting their current reading level assessments.
                            <br>
                            The quiz taking process includes a reflection to help the student understand their reading performance better.
                            This reflection will provide valuable feedback to the student, parent and teacher about the student’s learning
                            style and reading comprehension.

                        Our goal is to broaden the students reading horizon and create enjoyment through motivation and a love of reading!
